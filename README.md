## ðŸŒŸ About Me

I graduated from the EPFL Life Sciences Master's Program, specializing in neuroscience and neuro-engineering. Along the way, I fell in love with data analysis, machine learning, and mathematical modeling.  

I currently work at [CharitÃ© Berlin](https://www.brainsimulation.org/bsw/) in the Brain Simulation Section Lab, exploring the cutting edge of neuroscience and data-driven research.
