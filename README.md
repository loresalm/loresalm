## ðŸŒŸ About Me

I graduated from the Life Sciences Master's Program at EPFL, specializing in neuroscience and neuroengineering. Along the way, I fell in love with data analysis, machine learning, and mathematical modeling.  

I currently work at [CharitÃ© Berlin](https://www.brainsimulation.org/bsw/) in the Brain Simulation Section Lab, exploring the cutting edge of neuroscience and data-driven research.

## ðŸš€ Cool Projects

- **Wearable for Stroke Rehabilitation:** Developed an **IMU-based wearable** with Prof. Silvestro Micera and Andrea Crema, enabling stroke patients to perform physiotherapy at home. It reduced recovery time and costsâ€”a big win for healthcare!  
- **Heating System Anomaly Detection:** Collaborated with Prof. Roberto Castello at LESO Lab to create a **ML model** for detecting anomalies in building heating systems using time-series sensor data.
